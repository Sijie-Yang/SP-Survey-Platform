  'TrueSkill uses sequential decisive pairwise updates. Multiway choices/rankings are expanded into dependent pairs; rankings are exploratory, not significance tests.',
  'muStd5 is min-max scaling within the current question/sample; it is not a cross-study rating scale.',
  'When a question samples one category per trial, TrueSkill is fit separately per category. Rank, μ, and muStd5 stay inside that category. Other sampling modes keep one ranking.',
  'Krippendorff alpha uses coincidence weighting for unequal coder counts; absent overlap or zero expected disagreement yields no alpha.',
  'Kendall W requires complete strict rankings of the same items. Borda and mean ranks with varying sets are descriptive within those sets.',
  'Video segments use half-open intervals with at most one contribution per response per bucket. Continuous ratings average within response/bucket before averaging across responses.',
  'Video response units may include repeated trials/submissions from a participant; they are not independent participant counts.',
  'budget_compliance_rate permits partial spending; budget_full_use_rate reports complete spending.',
  'Paper methods are opt-in. Q-score follows Salesses et al. (2013): ties enter the denominator only, and images below the minimum comparison count are not scored. Tie-aware TrueSkill treats ties as draws; order-averaged TrueSkill refits on seeded permutations. Min–max scaling is sample-relative.',
  'Rater agreement uses two-way random, absolute-agreement ICC(2,1) and ICC(2,k) on the largest complete stimulus × rater matrix; median aggregation can screen ratings beyond k × MAD from the image median.',
  'Reverse-coded pairwise questions count the chosen image as the loser before scoring. Condition and subgroup comparisons report between-group Spearman correlations of image scores and Welch tests on participant-level agreement with the pooled ranking.',
